# Computer Structure - Memory Game Project

## About This Course
This hands-on course took me deep into low-level programming by building a Memory game in x86 Assembly. Through progressive challenges, I learned how computers work at their core.

## My Practical Work

### Basic Level (Weeks 1-2)
I built the game's core interface:
- Implemented cursor positioning (`posCurScreen`)
- Created movement controls (ijkl keys)
- Developed continuous movement mode
- Programmed card revealing logic

The hardest part was converting between:
- Matrix indices (0-4, A-D)
- Screen coordinates (row/col calculations)
- Memory offsets (indexMat formulas)

### Intermediate Level (Weeks 3-4)
I added game mechanics:
- Developed card pairing logic
- Implemented turn-based gameplay
- Created visual feedback systems:
  - Player indicators
  - Pair counters
  - Card state tracking

### Advanced Level (Weeks 5-6)
I completed the full game:
- Added two-player mode
- Implemented score tracking
- Created win condition detection
- Developed game flow control

## Working Environment
We used:
- Microsoft Visual Studio 2019
- MASM assembler
- x86 architecture
- Custom C framework (provided)

Key techniques mastered:
- Register management
- Stack operations
- Memory addressing modes
- System calls via C functions

## Final Thoughts
From struggling with simple MOV instructions to implementing a complete game, this course transformed my understanding of how high-level code actually runs on hardware. The progressive difficulty (basic → intermediate → advanced) made complex concepts manageable.
