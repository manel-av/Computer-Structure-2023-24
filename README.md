# Computer Structure

## Course Description

In this subject, we explored how computers work at a low level, including the processor, memory, and input/output operations. We studied how instructions are executed and how hardware components interact.

## Practical Work

We developed a Memory Game using Assembly language. The project was divided into three levels:

1. **Basic Level:** Implementing cursor movement and basic user input handling.

2. **Intermediate Level:** Implementing logic to check for matching card pairs.

3. **Advanced Level:** Enabling multiplayer functionality and keeping track of scores.
This project allowed us to gain hands-on experience with low-level programming, working directly with memory operations and optimizing execution speed in Assembly.
